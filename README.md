This is a simple and useful package to help you on arithmetics.

----
## Context

If you've ever tried to sum decimal numbers in JavaScript, you were definitely surprised...

We know that `0.1 + 0.1` is, as you expect, `0.2`.

But sometimes you get some unexpected result.

As for `0.1 + 0.2`.

The result is not `0.3` as you would expect, but it is `0.30000000000000004`.

Yes, the first time I was surprised too. However, if you search further to find out what happens via these links:

## Install

```sh
npm install metic
```

### Usage
```javascript
import metic from 'metic'
// import {metic} from 'metic'

metic.add(0.1, 0.2) // => 0.3
```

You can also use as many decimals places as you like and ensure the value will be as close to what you expect.

```javascript
import metic from 'metic'
// import {metic} from 'metic'

/**
 * Calculate the sum of two decimals properly.
 * @param {number} a - First value to be considered in the sum.
 * @param {number} b - Second value to be considered in the sum.
 * @param {number} positions - Number of decimals we expect as our result.
 */
metic.add(0.1, 0.222, 3) // => 0.322
```
